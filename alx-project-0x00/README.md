React Genesis: Mastering Next.js Setup
Level: Novice
Project Weight: 1
Duration: July 14, 2025 – July 21, 2025

This project is part of the ALX Front-End Curriculum and focuses on building modern web applications using React, TypeScript, and Next.js. It simulates the UI and features of an Airbnb-style platform, introducing fundamental concepts of reusable components, routing, and responsive design.

Project Overview
This project aims to give you hands-on experience with the Next.js framework and modern front-end practices. You’ll scaffold a project, create reusable components, implement basic routing, and style using Tailwind CSS, all while following TypeScript best practices.

The project structure and tasks are designed to mimic a real-world development workflow, ensuring that you build a strong foundation for modern front-end development.

Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you will be able to:

Scaffold a Next.js project with TypeScript using npx create-next-app.

Understand the Next.js folder structure and best practices for organizing files.

Implement basic routing using the Pages Router.

Create reusable React components with TypeScript props and interfaces.

Manage assets and static files in Next.js.

Apply responsive design using Tailwind CSS.

Set up and configure ESLint for code quality and style consistency.

Understand component composition and modular design patterns.

Tech Stack & Requirements
Core Technologies
React (v18+)

Next.js (v13+)

TypeScript

Tailwind CSS

ESLint

Development Requirements
Node.js v16+

npm or yarn

Visual Studio Code (or any preferred IDE)

Best Practices
Project Structure
All components are stored in the components/ directory.

TypeScript interfaces are centralized in interfaces/.

Pages are located in the pages/ directory, following Next.js conventions.

Component Design
Functional components are typed using TypeScript interfaces.

Components are modular, reusable, and follow the single responsibility principle.

Code Quality
ESLint enforces consistent code style.

TypeScript ensures type safety.

Arrow function syntax is used throughout the project.

Styling
Tailwind CSS is used for utility-first styling.

Responsive design and consistent spacing are applied.

Performance
Next.js <Image /> component is used for optimized images.

Code splitting and pre-fetching are handled automatically by Next.js.

Project Tasks
0. Scaffolding a Project
Initialize a Next.js project with TypeScript, ESLint, and Tailwind CSS.

Run your app on http://localhost:3000.

1. Setting Up Project Directories
Create components/ and interfaces/ directories.

Convert pages/index.tsx to an arrow function and export at the bottom.

2. Basic Routing
Create pages/landing.tsx and pages/about.tsx with functional components.

3. Rendering Components
Build a Card and Pill component to display Airbnb-style property data.

4. Using Components
Import and reuse the Card component inside landing.tsx.

5. Typing Components
Use a PillProps interface in interfaces/index.ts to type the Pill component.

6. Advanced Task
Create a Button component with customizable styles and sizes (small, medium, large).
